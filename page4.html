    <h1>The Story Of My Life</h1>    
    
        <p><span class="font-weight:bold.title">Waiting</span><br>
        The next morning, I woke up to the entry of the general doctor who just came to give me my medicine then left.<br>
        Then when the nurse came to give me food and draw blood, my mom asked when the neurologist will come.<br>
        The nurse said she can't come because she is pregnant, but is monitering my EEG, since it was still on,<br>
        One day, then two then three, the days just went by, and yet no neurologist came to see me,<br>
        Then after a few days there a neurologist finally came, and dischared me.</p>
