        <p><span class="font-weight:bold.title">India</span><br>
        Junior year of high school, during Covid I had my first seizure.<br>
        I woke up in the hospital not knowing what happened and where I was.<br>
        I woke up to my mom crying and on the phone with my dad and brother who were also crying,<br>
        After that one scarey night, I forgot how to be a normal person again,<br>
        The only thing I kept thinking of after that night, was that I won't ever be a normal human bring, andn I will be seen differently by everyone around me.</p>
