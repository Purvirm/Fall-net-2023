        The moment I got discharged, I finally met my dad and my brother.<br>
        The moment I went home I called my friends and felt relieved that i'm not in the hospital anymore.<br>
        I went and asked my family not to sit with me and spend time with me,<br>
        Even though I was scared, I didn't want to show it on my face, otherwise they would feel scared,<br>
        I was releived to be back home in my home and in my room.</p>
