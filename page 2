        When I came back home, I was fine for a while, until I once again had to go to the hospital.<br>
        Except this time conscious, and I was able to see what was happening around me, my parents getting scared, my brother a mess again.<br>
        But this time I saw them face to face this time and not on the phone,<br>
        Once the police and the ambulance came, it felt real, hearing the sirens as they took me out on the stretcher,<br>
        It just didn't feel normal because instead of an ambulance passing my with its sirens for someone else, it was going to pass by several cars because of me.</p>
