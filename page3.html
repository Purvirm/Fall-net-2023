    <h1>The Story Of My Life</h1>    
    
        <p><span class="font-weight:bold.title">The Hospital</span><br>
        Once I got to the hospital, it felt weird, because I have never been taken to a hospital in an ambulance.<br>
        Once I got there, they did their routinely tests and forms they need filled out.<br>
        After sometime, the doctor comes by and sees me and then tells the nurse to give me the SOS medication as well as adding some Benadryl to it so I can fall asleep,<br>
        After awhile I wake up to see that I am being pushed to a room, a private room, since I had tested positive for Covid, and in the back I hear my parents talking to each other,<br>
        A few minutes after getting to the room, The nurses start to put wires on my head for an EEG scan.</p>
